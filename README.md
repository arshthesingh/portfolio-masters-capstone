# Master’s Capstone Project: Data-Driven Portfolio Optimization
I have always been fascinated by how companies operate and how their strategic decisions influence short-, medium-, and long-term performance. During my undergraduate studies in Economics, microeconomics played a pivotal role in shaping my understanding of business dynamics. Now, with a deepened expertise in data analytics, my Master's Capstone Project focuses on analyzing medium- to long-term company performance and its implications for portfolio construction.

## Project Objective
Unlike traditional stock prediction models that rely solely on past prices to forecast future performance, this project takes a fundamental approach. The goal is not to "play" the market but rather to identify key financial indicators—extracted from income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements—that provide meaningful insights into a company's financial health. By leveraging these insights, we aim to develop a data-driven framework for constructing a robust, long-term investment portfolio.

## Sector-Based Analysis
A key component of this project is understanding how financial trends vary across different sectors. It is evident that certain industries exhibit inherent biases in specific financial metrics due to the nature of their operations. By examining sector-level trends, we can refine our portfolio strategy to account for these structural differences, ensuring a more comprehensive and informed investment approach.

## Why This Project Matters
This project bridges the gap between financial analysis and data science, providing a systematic, data-driven perspective on long-term portfolio optimization. By integrating financial fundamentals with data analytics, we aim to enhance decision-making processes for investors, businesses, and financial analysts alike.
